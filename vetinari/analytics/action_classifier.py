"""Three-tier action classification for human-in-the-loop governance.

Classifies all agent actions into three tiers:
- Allow: Safe actions that proceed without human involvement (read-only queries,
  status checks, low-risk tool calls)
- RequireApproval: Destructive or sensitive actions that pause for human review
  (production changes, compliance-sensitive operations)
- Deny: Actions outside the agent's authorized scope, blocked with a rejection
  rationale

This is a governance component in the analytics pipeline. It sits between the
agent that proposes an action and the executor that carries it out, ensuring
humans remain in the loop for consequential decisions.

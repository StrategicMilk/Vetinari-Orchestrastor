"""Shared dataclasses, enums, and helper classes for the AgentGraph.

This module contains types that are co-owned by the orchestration engine and
by external consumers (tests, two_layer orchestrator, etc.) without pulling in
the full AgentGraph machinery.  Keeping them here breaks the import-chain that
would otherwise occur when external modules need a lightweight reference to
``TaskNode`` or ``ExecutionPlan``.

Exported:
    ExecutionStrategy — parallel/sequential/adaptive strategy enum
    ConditionalEdge   — conditional routing edge in the DAG
    CycleDetector     — tracks per-task iteration counts
    HumanCheckpoint   — human-in-the-loop approval management
    TaskNode          — single node in the execution DAG
    ExecutionPlan     — full execution plan with task graph
    ReplanResult      — result of a mid-execution replan request

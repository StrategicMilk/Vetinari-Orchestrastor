"""Re-export shim for shared orchestration data types.

Provides a single import location for the core orchestration dataclasses
and enums used across execution_graph, durable_execution, plan_generator,
and two_layer modules.  New code MAY import directly from the defining
module; this shim exists so that callers with broad needs can do::

    from vetinari.orchestration.types import TaskNode, Checkpoint, ExecutionEvent

# Durable-execution layer — import from durable_db (the defining module) to
# avoid a circular import: durable_execution imports orchestration/__init__,
# which imports this module, which tried to import from durable_execution.

# Execution-graph layer
from vetinari.orchestration.execution_graph import ExecutionGraph, ExecutionTaskNode

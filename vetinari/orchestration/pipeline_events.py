"""Pipeline event protocol for decoupled stage notifications.

Defines the PipelineEventHandler protocol that allows the TwoLayerOrchestrator
to emit structured stage events without knowing who consumes them. The web SSE
handler, CLI, tests, and any future consumer implement this protocol.

This eliminates the 590-line reimplementation in projects_api.py by allowing
the orchestrator to drive all pipeline logic while the web layer only handles
event display (ADR-0072).

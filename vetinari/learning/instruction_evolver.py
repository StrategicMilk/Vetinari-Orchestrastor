"""Self-Evolving Instruction Architecture — 4-tier mutability system.

Agent instructions evolve automatically based on execution outcomes. Four tiers
of mutability ensure safety while enabling continuous improvement:

1. Constitutional (IMMUTABLE): Safety rules, ethical constraints — hash-verified, human-only changes
2. Structural (HUMAN-APPROVAL): Architecture decisions, role definitions — system proposes, human gates
3. Behavioral (AUTO-EVOLVE + VERIFY): Task instructions, prompt templates — auto-modify with verification
4. Tactical (FREELY EVOLVE): Few-shot examples, style preferences — evolve without gate

Decision: 4-tier mutability architecture for self-evolving instructions.

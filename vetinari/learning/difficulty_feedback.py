"""Difficulty calibration for Vetinari model routing.

Compares predicted task difficulty with observed outcome signals and feeds
calibration data back into model routing.

Writer: base_agent_completion.py calls record_difficulty_feedback() after each task.
Reader: model_router_scoring.py:assess_difficulty() uses get_calibration_bias() to
adjust its heuristic output based on historical prediction accuracy.

This module is step 6b in the completion pipeline: after episodic memory is
recorded, difficulty predictions are calibrated against observed signals so
that future model routing uses empirically corrected difficulty estimates.

"""Config migration — versioned schema upgrades for YAML config files.

When Vetinari's config schema evolves, this module handles automatic
migration from older versions to the current one.  Each config file
carries a ``config_version`` integer at the top level.  On load, the
migration chain runs all N->N+1 steps needed to reach the current
version.  The original file is backed up before any migration.

Usage::

    from vetinari.utils.config_migration import migrate_config

    data = migrate_config(Path("config/rules.yaml"), CURRENT_VERSION, MIGRATIONS)

    If the file has no ``config_version`` key, it's treated as version 0.
    Each migration step N->N+1 is applied in order until the config
    reaches ``current_version``.  The original file is backed up to
    ``{path}.bak`` before any migration writes.

    Args:
        config_path: Path to the YAML config file.
        current_version: The target schema version.
        migrations: Mapping of ``from_version -> migration_function``.
            Each function receives the config dict and returns the
            updated dict (may mutate in place).

    Returns:
        The migrated config dict with ``config_version`` set to
        ``current_version``.

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If config_path does not exist.

"""Auto-Gemba Walk — Systematic Execution Review.

Automated review of actual execution history to surface improvement
opportunities. Implements the "go see the actual work" principle from
lean manufacturing — the system reviews its own traces to find patterns
that humans might miss.

Runs on-demand or on a weekly schedule. Findings are proposed as
improvements in the ImprovementLog.

"""Kaizen improvement event emitters — publish lifecycle events to the EventBus.

Each function fires a typed event when an improvement transitions state
(proposed → active → confirmed/reverted). Consumers that subscribe to these
events (aggregator, notification system) receive real-time updates without
polling the database.

These are standalone functions so they can be unit-tested without
instantiating ImprovementLog.

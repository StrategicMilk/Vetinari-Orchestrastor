"""Kaizen defect occurrence log — records and queries quality defects.

Maintains the ``defect_occurrences`` table that feeds the DefectTrendAnalyzer.
Every quality rejection from the Inspector agent flows through here so that
curriculum training and PDCA planning can prioritize the most common failure
categories.

This module owns the write side of the defect feedback loop; the read side
lives in ``kaizen.defect_trends`` (trend aggregation) and
``training.curriculum`` (training prioritization).

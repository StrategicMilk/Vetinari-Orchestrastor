"""Disk and system resource monitoring for Vetinari.

Monitors available disk space and applies tiered thresholds to protect
against running out of storage. Threshold tiers:
OK (<80%), WARN (80-89%), PAUSE (90-94%), READ_ONLY (>=95%).
Safety buffer is proportional to total capacity (2% or 200MB minimum),
so small volumes are not overwhelmed by a flat 500MB reserve.

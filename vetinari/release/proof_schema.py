"""Release proof artifact schema for Vetinari.

Defines the frozen dataclasses that represent a single release-doctor run.
Every release claim MUST be backed by a ``ReleaseProof`` JSON artifact written
to ``outputs/release/<version>/proof.json``.

Schema version:
    PROOF_SCHEMA_VERSION = "1"

    Consumers MUST refuse artifacts whose ``schema_version`` field does not
    equal ``PROOF_SCHEMA_VERSION``.  There is intentionally no backwards-compat
    fallback -- old artifacts must be regenerated, not silently accepted.

This is step 0 of the release pipeline: schema definition that all other
release tooling builds on.

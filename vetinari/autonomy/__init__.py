"""Autonomy subsystem — trust framework and approval workflows.

Provides the AutonomyGovernor (policy engine controlling what actions
proceed without human approval) and the ApprovalQueue (SQLite-backed
queue for actions that need human sign-off).

This is the gate that makes Vetinari a *trustworthy* autonomous agent,
not just one that runs.

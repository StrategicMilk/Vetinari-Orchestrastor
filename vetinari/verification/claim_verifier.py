"""Fail-closed claim verification hooks for the Inspector pipeline.

Enforces six failure modes that MUST produce ``OutcomeSignal(passed=False)``:

1. Missing citation: a claim carries no Provenance or evidence -> UNSUPPORTED.
2. Stale evidence: evidence older than the configured freshness window -> UNSUPPORTED.
3. Unverified file claim: claimed file does not exist or SHA-256 hash mismatches -> UNSUPPORTED.
4. Entailment contradiction: static entailment checker flags a false claim -> UNSUPPORTED.
5. Bare HUMAN_ATTESTED on high-accuracy factual claim (no attested_artifacts) -> UNSUPPORTED.
6. LLM-only on high-accuracy claim: basis <= LLM_JUDGMENT -> LLM_JUDGMENT with advisory.

HUMAN_ATTESTED-with-artifact narrowing (used by cases 5b-d):
- A matching COMMIT_SHA whose diff contains the claimed change -> passes.
- A SIGNED_REVIEW whose scope covers the file being claimed about -> passes.
- An ADR_REFERENCE unrelated to the claim scope -> rejected ("artifact does not support claim").
- SIGNED_REVIEW on an intent-confirmation use case -> passes (not a factual closure path).

Rule 2 invariant: ``OutcomeSignal.score`` MUST be 0.0 whenever ``basis`` is
``EvidenceBasis.UNSUPPORTED``.

This is step 4 of the pipeline: Intake → Planning → Execution → **Quality Gate** → Assembly.

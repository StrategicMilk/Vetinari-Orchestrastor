"""WIP + Andon wiring — connects the WIP tracker and Andon stop-the-line system into the task dispatch pipeline.

This is the dispatch gate layer: every task entering the Foreman->Worker->
Inspector pipeline passes through here before an agent slot is claimed.
WIP limits prevent resource exhaustion by capping concurrent tasks per agent
type.  The Andon system halts all dispatch when critical quality failures are
detected, implementing a factory-floor "stop-the-line" pattern.

Pipeline position: Intake -> Planning -> **Dispatch Gate** -> Execution -> Quality Gate.

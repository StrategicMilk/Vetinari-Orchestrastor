"""Lifecycle policy protocol and concrete policy implementations.

Defines the ``Policy`` protocol that ``LifecycleStore`` consumes and the two
concrete policies — ``RecyclePolicy`` (short grace window, hard-delete allowed)
and ``ArchivePolicy`` (unbounded retention, view-tiered, no hard delete) — that
back the ``RecycleStore`` and ``ArchiveStore`` facades respectively.

This is step 1 of the lifecycle subsystem; the shared store and the two facades
are built on top of these policy objects.

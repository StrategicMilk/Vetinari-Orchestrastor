"""ACON — Adaptive Context Optimization Network.

Failure-driven context compression that learns which information types must
be preserved.  When compressed context leads to a task failure that full
context would have avoided, the compression rules are updated to preserve
that information category in future compressions.

This is step between Planning and Execution in the pipeline:
Intake → Planning → **Context Compression** → Execution → Quality Gate → Assembly.

"""Issue tracker integration — abstract interface for external issue systems.

Provides a unified API for creating, updating, and querying issues across
GitHub Issues, Linear, and Jira. Adapters are instantiated via the
``create_issue_tracker`` factory, which reads ``config/integrations.yaml``.

This is a standalone integration layer — it is not part of the core agent
pipeline. It allows Vetinari tasks and quality gates to file issues in an
external tracker without coupling to any specific vendor API.

"""Agent Permission System — action-level authorization for agent operations.

Defines the canonical set of actions agents may attempt, maps agent types
to permission policies, and provides dual-permission checking (both the
requesting agent and its target must authorize an action).

Permission checks MUST fail closed: any exception during evaluation results
in DENIED, never ALLOWED.  This follows the fail-closed security principle.

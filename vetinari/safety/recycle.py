"""RecycleStore — short-grace-window recycle bin backed by LifecycleStore.

``RecycleStore`` is a thin facade over ``LifecycleStore`` configured with
``RecyclePolicy``.  It is the ONLY path in the system that hard-deletes bytes
(via ``purge_expired()``), and that method is the SHARD-02 / VET142 exclusion
target — its exact qualified name ``vetinari.safety.recycle.RecycleStore.purge_expired``
MUST remain stable so the VET142 pre-commit check can exclude it from the
"no bare shutil.rmtree in production code" rule.

All other destructive routes call ``RecycleStore.retire()`` BEFORE any
filesystem deletion so the entity can be restored within the grace window.

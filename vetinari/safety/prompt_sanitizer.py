"""Prompt injection protection — sanitizes untrusted text before it reaches LLM prompts.

Untrusted content enters the pipeline from two sources:
1. Task descriptions provided by users or upstream systems.
2. Worker agent output that the Inspector evaluates.

Both sources can contain adversarial phrases designed to override the agent's
instructions (e.g., "IGNORE PREVIOUS INSTRUCTIONS"). This module provides
deterministic sanitization for both cases before the text is interpolated into
system or user prompts.

This is a security module in the pipeline: it runs before LLM inference, not
after. It does NOT attempt semantic analysis — that is intentionally left to the
LLM and the guardrails layer. This module handles the deterministic, pattern-based
threat class only.

This is step 0 of the pipeline: **Sanitization** → Intake → Planning → Execution → Quality Gate → Assembly.

    Code content (e.g. ``task.context["code"]``) receives lighter sanitization:

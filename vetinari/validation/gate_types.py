"""Shared data types for the quality gate subsystem.

Contains enum and dataclass definitions used by both ``quality_gates.py``
(the runner and threshold data) and ``gate_checks.py`` (the check
implementations). Extracted to a separate module to avoid circular imports.

Public names:
- ``VerificationMode`` — modes for the TESTER agent
- ``GateResult`` — gate outcome (PASSED / FAILED / WARNING)
- ``QualityGateConfig`` — frozen config for a single gate
- ``GateCheckResult`` — result produced by one gate check

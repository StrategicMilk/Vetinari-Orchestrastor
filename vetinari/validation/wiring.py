"""Validation subsystem wiring.

Connects quality gates and the verification pipeline into the
Foreman->Worker->Inspector factory pipeline.

Quality gates run at pipeline stage transitions to prevent low-quality work
from propagating. The verification pipeline runs as part of Inspector
evaluation.

    Planning -> **Quality Gate** -> Execution -> **Quality Gate**

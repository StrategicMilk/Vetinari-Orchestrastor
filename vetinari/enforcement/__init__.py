"""Vetinari runtime constraint enforcement package.

Provides four enforcers that validate agent operations against the constraints
declared in each agent's ``AgentSpec``:

- ``DelegationDepthValidator``  — caps delegation nesting via ``max_delegation_depth``
- ``QualityGateEnforcer``       — enforces minimum quality scores via ``quality_gate_score``
- ``FileJurisdictionEnforcer``  — restricts file access via ``jurisdiction``
- ``AgentCapabilityEnforcer``   — checks capability availability via ``capabilities``

The ``enforce_all()`` convenience function runs all four checks in a single call
and is the recommended entry point for orchestration layers that want broad
coverage without importing each enforcer individually.

Violation aggregation: ``enforce_all()`` evaluates **every** applicable check,
collects all failures, and raises after all checks complete.  A single failure
re-raises as its original exception type; multiple failures are wrapped in
``CompositeEnforcementError`` so the caller sees the full set of violations.

Usage::

    from vetinari.enforcement import enforce_all

    # Raises after collecting all violations; returns None if all pass.
    enforce_all(
        agent_type=AgentType.WORKER,
        current_depth=1,
        quality_score=0.85,
        file_path="vetinari/agents/builder.py",
        required_capability="code_scaffolding",
    )

    """Run all applicable enforcement checks for a single agent operation.

    Each check is only performed when the corresponding argument is provided.
    Checks are run in the following order:

    1. Delegation depth (if ``current_depth`` is given)
    2. Quality gate   (if ``quality_score`` is given)
    3. File jurisdiction (if ``file_path`` is given)
    4. Capability     (if ``required_capability`` is given)

    All applicable checks are evaluated regardless of intermediate failures.
    Violations are collected and raised together after all checks complete —
    a single violation re-raises as its original exception type, while
    multiple violations are wrapped in ``CompositeEnforcementError``.

    Args:
        agent_type: The agent type to validate against.
        current_depth: Delegation depth for depth enforcement.  Skipped when
            ``None``.
        quality_score: Quality score for quality gate enforcement.  Skipped when
            ``None``.
        file_path: File path for jurisdiction enforcement.  Skipped when ``None``.
        required_capability: Capability name for capability enforcement.  Skipped
            when ``None``.
        **_kwargs: Accepted but ignored — allows callers to pass extra context
            without breaking the call signature.

    Raises:
        CompositeEnforcementError: When one or more checks fail. Contains all
            individual violations so callers see the full picture.
        DelegationDepthExceeded: When only the depth check fails (single violation).
        QualityGateFailed: When only the quality gate check fails (single violation).
        JurisdictionViolation: When only the jurisdiction check fails (single violation).
        CapabilityNotAvailable: When only the capability check fails (single violation).

    """Validates file paths against the agent's jurisdiction list in AgentSpec.

    A file is considered within jurisdiction if its normalised path starts with
    any entry in ``AgentSpec.jurisdiction``, matched at a path-component
    boundary (so ``docs/`` cannot be bypassed by ``docs/../vetinari/``).

    Path normalisation:
    - Backslashes replaced with forward slashes (cross-platform).
    - ``..`` path traversal segments resolved via ``os.path.normpath`` so that
      ``docs/../vetinari/agents/contracts.py`` is collapsed to
      ``vetinari/agents/contracts.py`` before prefix matching.

    Example:
        >>> enforcer = FileJurisdictionEnforcer()
        >>> enforcer.validate(AgentType.INSPECTOR, "tests/test_foo.py")  # passes
        >>> enforcer.validate(AgentType.WORKER, "vetinari/core/main.py")  # passes or raises

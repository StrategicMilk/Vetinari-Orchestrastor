"""Circuit breaker wiring — per-agent inference call protection.

Thin wrapper that connects the inference path to the CircuitBreaker registry.
Every outbound LLM call flows through here so that a misbehaving backend trips
the appropriate breaker and fails fast instead of stacking up blocked threads.

Pipeline role: sits between the agent execution layer and the adapter layer.
When an agent calls an LLM backend, it passes the callable through
``call_with_breaker`` so that repeated failures trip the breaker and subsequent
calls are rejected immediately (CircuitBreakerOpen) until the backend recovers.

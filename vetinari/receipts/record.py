"""WorkReceipt record and WorkReceiptKind enum.

A WorkReceipt is the durable answer to "what did this agent actually do
and did it succeed?" One receipt is appended per discrete unit of work
(planning round, worker task, inspector pass, training step, release
step). The embedded ``OutcomeSignal`` carries the evidence basis so the
Control Center and audit tools can distinguish tool-evidence-backed
verdicts from LLM-judgment ones.

The receipt is the unit the Attention track on the Control Center reads
to surface projects blocked on user input, with a structured
``awaiting_reason`` set by Foreman or Inspector at the time the block
was detected.

    Receipts are immutable: once appended to the store they are never
    rewritten. Mutations to project state happen via new receipts that
    reference earlier ones by ``receipt_id``.

    Attributes:
        receipt_id: Unique identifier for this receipt (defaults to a
            fresh UUID hex string).
        project_id: Identifier of the project this receipt belongs to.
        agent_id: Concrete agent instance identifier (not the agent type).
        agent_type: The actor role. For factory-pipeline work this is
            FOREMAN / WORKER / INSPECTOR (ADR-0061); for auxiliary
            runners outside the factory pipeline (training, release)
            this is TRAINING / RELEASE (ADR-0103). Use the AgentType
            enum, never a raw string.
        kind: Discrete kind of work this receipt records.
        started_at_utc: ISO-8601 UTC timestamp the work began.
        finished_at_utc: ISO-8601 UTC timestamp the work finished.
        inputs_summary: Plain-English summary of the inputs (<=200 chars).
        outputs_summary: Plain-English summary of the outputs (<=200 chars).
        outcome: The OutcomeSignal that backs the verdict. Carries the
            evidence basis so consumers can decide whether to trust the
            verdict for promotion or release purposes.
        awaiting_user: True iff this receipt represents a project blocked
            on user input. Setting this to True requires a non-empty
            ``awaiting_reason`` (enforced in ``__post_init__``).
        awaiting_reason: Plain-English reason the project is awaiting the
            user (e.g. "plan reviewer refused -- TS-14 non-goals matched").
            Empty string when ``awaiting_user`` is False.
        linked_claim_ids: Identifiers of ClaimsLedger records this
            receipt cites. Empty when the kind has no claim linkage.

    Raises:
        ValueError: At construction time when ``awaiting_user`` is True
            and ``awaiting_reason`` is empty or whitespace, or when an
            inputs/outputs summary exceeds the 200-character limit.

"""SSE event handler — bridges pipeline events to Server-Sent Events.

Implements the PipelineEventHandler protocol from
``vetinari.orchestration.pipeline_events`` and translates each
``PipelineEvent`` into a call to ``_push_sse_event`` for delivery
to the browser via the project's SSE queue.

This handler is the web layer's sole hook into the pipeline — the
orchestrator knows nothing about SSE or Flask; it only calls
``handler.on_event(event)``.

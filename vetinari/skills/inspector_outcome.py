"""Inspector OutcomeSignal aggregation.

Combines multiple OutcomeSignals from sub-checks (tool wrappers, LLM verifiers,
and other inspectors) into a single consolidated verdict so downstream
consumers see one signal with explicit basis and provenance, not a bag of
heterogeneous results.

This is step 4 of the pipeline: Intake → Planning → Execution → **Quality Gate** → Assembly.

    Aggregation rules (in priority order):

      ``passed=False, basis=UNSUPPORTED``.

    "DECISION FRAMEWORK — code generation:\n"
    "1. Is this a class with state? -> Include __init__, __repr__, and property accessors\n"
    "2. Is this an external-facing API function? -> Include input validation and typed return\n"
    "3. Is this I/O (file, network, DB)? -> Wrap in try/except with specific exception types\n"
    "4. Is this a long-running operation? -> Add logging at start, completion, and error\n"
    "5. Are there secrets needed? -> Use os.environ.get() with clear error if missing\n"
    "6. Is this a utility function? -> Keep it pure (no side effects, same input same output)\n\n"
    "CODE QUALITY STANDARDS:\n"
    "- All functions must have type hints on parameters and return types\n"
    "- All public classes and functions must have docstrings (Google style)\n"
    "- No bare except clauses — always specify exception type\n"
    "- No hardcoded credentials, tokens, secrets, or magic numbers\n"
    "- No mutable default arguments (def f(x=[]) is forbidden)\n"
    "- Import only what is used — no wildcard imports\n\n"
    "SECURITY BY DEFAULT:\n"
    "- Never hardcode passwords, API keys, tokens, or any secrets\n"
    "- Use parameterized queries for all database access (never string concatenation)\n"
    "- Validate and sanitize all inputs that come from outside the system\n"
    "- Default to HTTPS, read-only permissions, least-privilege credentials\n"
    "- Use secrets.token_urlsafe() not random.random() for security tokens\n\n"
    "TESTING STANDARDS:\n"
    "- Every function must have at minimum: one happy-path test and one error-path test\n"
    "- Edge cases: empty string, None, zero, negative numbers, maximum boundary values\n"
    "- Use descriptive test names: test_function_name_when_condition_then_outcome\n"
    "- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern strictly\n"
    "- Use pytest.raises() for exception tests, never try/except in tests\n"
    "- Include at least one parametrized test for functions with multiple valid inputs\n\n"

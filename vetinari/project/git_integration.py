"""Git branch strategy for autonomous code changes.

This module wraps :class:`vetinari.tools.git_tool.GitOperations` with
higher-level helpers that follow Vetinari's branch naming convention and
generate human-readable pull-request descriptions from scan findings.

Pipeline role: Step 3 of 4 — branch management. After the sandbox confirms
a proposed change is safe, this module creates the feature branch, stages
the files, and produces a PR description ready to open on GitHub/GitLab.

Naming convention: all autonomous fix branches are prefixed
``vetinari/fix/`` so they are easy to identify and clean up later.

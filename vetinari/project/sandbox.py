"""Sandbox execution — test code changes safely before committing them.

This module is step 2 of Vetinari's autonomous improvement pipeline:
Scan → **Sandbox** → Fix → Verify.

Before any automated change is committed to the target project, it is first
applied to a temporary git worktree (the "sandbox"). The sandbox runs the
project's test suite and linter so a bad fix cannot reach the real branch.
If the checks pass, the caller can promote the change to a real branch via
git_integration. If they fail, the sandbox is discarded with no side effects.

Pipeline role: Safety gate. Every proposed change must pass sandbox checks
before it is eligible for a commit or pull request.

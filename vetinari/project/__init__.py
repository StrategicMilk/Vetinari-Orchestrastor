"""Project automation package — autonomous scanning, fixing, and maintenance.

This package implements the scan-prioritize-fix pipeline that lets Vetinari
autonomously improve a target codebase. Each module handles one step:
scanner finds issues, sandbox tests fixes safely, and git_integration manages
branches and PRs.

Pipeline role: Post-execution tooling. After the Foreman->Worker->Inspector
pipeline produces code, this package validates and improves the output in the
target project before it is committed.

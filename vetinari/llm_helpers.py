"""Lightweight LLM call helpers for classification, scoring, and analysis.

Provides simple functions for making quick LLM calls used by the

complexity routing, etc.). These are thin wrappers around the
AdapterManager that handle unavailability gracefully.

All functions return None when the LLM is unavailable, letting callers

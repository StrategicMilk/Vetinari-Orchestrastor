# Training and Self-Improvement

Vetinari continuously improves itself through three interconnected systems:

1. **Idle-Time Training Pipeline** — QLoRA fine-tuning executed during idle periods
2. **Kaizen Continuous Improvement** — PDCA lifecycle for systematic improvement tracking
3. **Feedback Loop** — Execution outcomes feed back into model selection and learning

These systems are designed to close the loop: every task Vetinari executes produces signals that eventually influence how it performs future tasks.

## Idle-Time Training Pipeline

### Trigger Conditions

The pipeline activates when the system has been idle for 5+ minutes and all preconditions pass:

| Precondition | Threshold |
|---|---|
| Free VRAM | ≥ 8 GB |
| Training records available | ≥ 100 records |
| Base model present | Must be locally available |

Training can also be triggered manually via the CLI (see [CLI Commands](#cli-commands)).

### Pipeline Execution Steps

1. Check preconditions (VRAM, records, base model)
2. Select next activity from the curriculum (priority-based)
3. Mix current training data with replay buffer (80/20 split)
4. Execute QLoRA fine-tuning with continual learning protections active
5. Validate results — regression must be < 5%
6. Deploy as LoRA adapter if validation passes

### Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `vetinari/training/pipeline.py` | Main training orchestration |
| `vetinari/training/idle_scheduler.py` | Idle detection and scheduling |
| `vetinari/training/validation.py` | Pre- and post-training checks |
| `vetinari/training/continual_learning.py` | Forgetting protection |

---

## Curriculum System

**File:** `vetinari/training/curriculum.py`

The curriculum decides what to train on next. It operates in three phases based on how much data has been collected.

### Phases

| Phase | Condition | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| CALIBRATION | < 50 training records | Broad assessment across all skills |
| TARGETED_SKILL_BUILDING | ≥ 50 records and weakest skill < 0.7 | Focus on the lowest-scoring skill |
| CONTINUOUS_IMPROVEMENT | All skills ≥ 0.7 | Steady-state improvement across the board |

### Activity Types

Activities are ranked by a computed priority score. The curriculum selects the highest-priority activity that satisfies its prerequisites.

| Activity | Priority Formula | Prerequisites |
|---|---|---|
| Fine-tune weak skill | `(0.7 - score) × 0.4` | Any skill with quality < 0.7 |
| Self-play reasoning | `min(0.8, records / 1000)` | Sufficient training records |
| External data integration | `availability × 0.3` | HuggingFace dataset reachable |
| Prompt evolution | `0.6` (fixed) | ≥ 5 prompt variants available |
| Distillation | `0.7` (fixed) | Overall quality ≥ 0.85 |
| Benchmark practice | `days_stale / 30` | Stale benchmark results |
| RLEF code execution | `0.65` (fixed) | ≥ 30 execution traces available |

View the current prioritized queue:

```bash
vetinari train curriculum
```

## Continual Learning Protections

Forgetting protection prevents new training from degrading previously learned skills.

### STABLERegularizer

Computes forward-pass metrics without gradient computation. Training halts if any threshold is exceeded.

| Metric | What It Measures | Threshold | Stop If |
|---|---|---|---|
| EM drop | Embedding norm change | 0.15 | > 2× threshold |
| KL divergence | Output distribution shift | 0.5 | > 2× threshold |
| Bits increase | Information gain per parameter | 0.3 | > 2× threshold |

### ReplayBuffer

Prevents catastrophic forgetting by mixing past examples into every training run.

- **Path:** `~/.vetinari/replay_buffer.jsonl`
- **Maximum size:** 5,000 entries
- **Mix ratio:** 80% current data, 20% replay
- **Sampling:** Stratified by domain to preserve diversity

### LoRAAdapterManager

Each skill gets its own LoRA adapter, preventing cross-skill interference.

- **Registry:** `~/.vetinari/adapters/registry.json`
- Each task type maps to an isolated adapter
- Adapters are independently deployed and versioned

### Adapter Inventory API

The mounted adapter inventory endpoints in `litestar_training_api_part2.py` are
read routes without `admin_guard`:

| Endpoint | Current fields exposed | Release classification |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/v1/training/models` | adapter ID, task type, adapter path, eval score, deployment status | Public exposure risk until 34F proves auth/redaction and 34G proves bounded registry reads |
| `GET /api/v1/training/adapters?task_type=...` | adapter ID, base model, task type, adapter path, eval score, deployment status | Public exposure risk until 34F/34G close proof |
| `GET /api/v1/training/adapters/deployed` | deployed adapter ID, base model, task type, adapter path, eval score | Public exposure risk until 34F/34G close proof |

Do not describe adapter paths, base model IDs, eval scores, or deployment state
as safe public data. Keep these endpoints on trusted localhost or route them to
future public proof for guarded, redacted, paginated behavior.

---

## Synthetic Data Generation

**File:** `vetinari/training/synthetic_data.py`

When real execution data is sparse, the pipeline generates synthetic training data through four pathways.

| Pathway | Source | Method | Quality Gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Coding challenge mining | Successful coding episodes | LLM generates variations on accepted episodes | Quality ≥ 0.75 |
| V-STaR reasoning chains | Problem traces | Generate rationale → verify via test execution and Inspector scoring | Quality ≥ 0.80 |
| DPO preference pairs | Same-prompt records | Pair records where score gap ≥ 0.2 as (chosen, rejected) | Score gap ≥ 0.2 |
| Self-play task generation | Templates | Generate tasks across 7 domains × 3 difficulty levels | Varies by domain |

---

## Data Seeding

**File:** `vetinari/training/data_seeder.py`

On first run, bootstrap datasets are downloaded to provide an initial training corpus.

| Dataset | Records | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `codeparrot/apps` | 5,000 | Coding evaluations |
| `mbpp` | 1,000 | Python basics |
| `hendrycks/competition_math` | 5,000 | Reasoning problems |
| `tatsu-lab/alpaca` | 10,000 | Instruction following |

**Location:** `~/.vetinari/training_data/`

Download manually:

```bash
vetinari train seed
```

---

## Per-Agent Training Priority

**File:** `vetinari/training/agent_trainer.py`

Each agent's training need is scored from three signals:

| Signal | Weight | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Rejection rate | 40% | How often this agent's output is rejected by the Inspector |
| Quality decline | 30% | Drop in recent quality scores vs. historical baseline |
| Staleness | 30% | Days elapsed since the agent last received training |

### Dataset Configuration per Agent

| Agent | Min Quality for Record | Max Training Examples | Training Method |
|---|---|---|---|
| Foreman | 0.82 | 2,500 | SFT |
| Worker | 0.85 | 8,000 | SFT |
| Inspector | 0.80 | 3,000 | DPO |

The Inspector uses DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) because its job is to discriminate between better and worse outputs — preference pairs are the natural training signal for that task.

View per-agent training history:

```bash
vetinari train history
```

---

## Prompt Evolution

The prompt evolution subsystem learns better prompts through systematic mutation and measurement.

### 8 Mutation Operators

**File:** `vetinari/learning/prompt_mutator.py`

| Operator | Effect |
|---|---|
| `INSTRUCTION_REPHRASE` | Reword task instructions while preserving semantics |
| `CONSTRAINT_INJECTION` | Add explicit execution constraints |
| `EXAMPLE_INJECTION` | Insert concrete input/output examples |
| `FORMAT_RESTRUCTURE` | Change output format (e.g., JSON vs. prose) |
| `REASONING_SCAFFOLD` | Add step-by-step reasoning structure |
| `ROLE_REINFORCEMENT` | Strengthen the agent's stated identity |
| `OUTPUT_SCHEMA_TIGHTEN` | Narrow the set of acceptable output forms |
| `CONTEXT_PRUNE` | Remove context sections that do not improve quality |

### Operator Selection via Thompson Sampling

**File:** `vetinari/learning/operator_selector.py`

Each `(operator, agent_type, mode)` combination has an independent Beta distribution arm. The system learns which operators improve which agents in which modes.

- Successful mutations increment `alpha`
- Failed mutations increment `beta`
- Decay factor `0.995` applied per update for non-stationarity adaptation
- Arms require ≥ 5 pulls before results are trusted

State is persisted to `VETINARI_STATE_DIR/operator_selector_state.json` so learning carries across restarts.

### MASPOB Section Ordering

Multi-Agent Section Position Optimization by Permutation tests different orderings of prompt sections and measures quality impact.

Default heuristic: role sections first, constraints near the end, examples immediately before the task statement. The system learns deviations from this heuristic when execution data supports them.

---

## Kaizen Continuous Improvement

**Directory:** `vetinari/kaizen/`

Kaizen applies a PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) lifecycle to systematic improvement tracking. It operates alongside the training pipeline and addresses process-level issues that gradient descent cannot fix directly.

### Improvement States

```
PROPOSED → ACTIVE → CONFIRMED
                  → FAILED
                  → REVERTED
```

### PDCA Lifecycle

**Plan — AutoGembaWalk**

AutoGembaWalk analyzes execution history for patterns that indicate a systemic problem. It proposes an improvement when it detects:

| Signal | Threshold |
|---|---|
| Recurring failure | ≥ 3 occurrences of the same failure pattern |
| High rework rate | > 20% of tasks require rework |
| Low value-add ratio | < 50% of effort produces accepted output |
| Dominant defect cause | > 40% of defects from a single category |
| Week-over-week defect increase | > 15% increase in any defect category |

**Do**

The `PDCAController` applies the proposed improvement through a registered applicator. Each improvement type has its own applicator (e.g., prompt rewrite, threshold adjustment, routing rule change).

**Check**

The system monitors outcomes over an observation window (default: 7 days). At the end of the window, it evaluates whether quality improved against the threshold.

**Act**

- If improvement is confirmed: persist override to the overrides file and mark `CONFIRMED`
- If regression detected (> 5%): revert the change and mark `REVERTED`

### Defect Categories

| Category | Description |
|---|---|
| `HALLUCINATION` | Output contains invented facts |
| `BAD_SPEC` | Task specification was underspecified or contradictory |
| `PROMPT_WEAKNESS` | Prompt did not elicit the required behavior |
| `WRONG_MODEL` | Wrong model selected for the task type |
| `INSUFFICIENT_CONTEXT` | Agent lacked necessary context to complete the task |
| `INTEGRATION_ERROR` | Failure at a system boundary (tool call, API, file I/O) |
| `COMPLEXITY_UNDERESTIMATE` | Task was harder than the planner estimated |

Defects are tracked as hotspots by `(agent_type, mode, defect_category)`. Week-over-week trends are monitored; a > 15% increase in any category triggers an auto-proposal.

### Kaizen CLI

```bash
vetinari kaizen report     # Weekly summary of improvements and outcomes
vetinari kaizen gemba      # Run AutoGembaWalk and show improvement proposals
```

---

## Feedback Loop

**File:** `vetinari/learning/feedback_loop.py`

The feedback loop is what makes the system self-improving rather than just self-monitoring. Every execution outcome flows back into three learning targets.

### Signal Computation

```
signal = 0.5 × success_flag + 0.5 × quality_score
```

Benchmark results carry 3× weight (`alpha = 0.5` instead of the standard `0.2`), because benchmarks are controlled evaluations with known correct answers.

### Update Targets

Each signal update is applied via exponential moving average (EMA, `alpha = 0.2`):

| Target | What Updates | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Memory store | Agent performance by task type | Future recall surface |
| Router cache | Model quality scores | Model selection for future tasks |
| Thompson Sampling arms | `(operator, agent_type, mode)` arms | Prompt mutation operator selection |

### User Feedback Integration

User feedback is replayed from `outputs/feedback/feedback.jsonl`:

| Feedback | Quality Signal |
|---|---|
| Thumbs up | 0.9 |
| Thumbs down | 0.2 |

User feedback overrides inferred quality when available.

## CLI Commands

### Training

```bash
vetinari train status              # Current phase, idle duration, next scheduled activity
vetinari train start               # Manually trigger a training run
vetinari train start --skill X     # Train a specific skill
vetinari train run                 # Run the pipeline directly (bypasses idle check)
vetinari train data                # Dataset statistics (record count, quality distribution)
vetinari train seed                # Download bootstrap seed datasets
vetinari train curriculum          # Show the prioritized activity queue
vetinari train history             # Per-agent training records
```

Pause and resume are parsed legacy subcommands, but they are not wired to a
local scheduler control path. They return a nonzero unsupported result instead
of claiming a state change.

### Kaizen

```bash
vetinari kaizen report             # Weekly improvement summary
vetinari kaizen gemba              # Execution review with auto-generated proposals
```

---

## Configuration

### `config/ml_config.yaml`

Core ML parameters:

```yaml
thompson_sampling:
  prior_alpha: 2.0          # Initial alpha for Beta distribution arms
  prior_beta: 2.0           # Initial beta — symmetric uninformative prior
  cost_weight: 0.15         # Weight given to inference cost in model selection
  exploration_bonus: 0.15   # Added to UCB score to encourage exploration

quality_scoring:
  default_score: 0.55       # Score assigned when no quality signal is available
  ema_alpha: 0.3            # EMA smoothing factor for quality score updates
  min_effect_size: 0.5      # Minimum Cohen's d to count as a real improvement

prompt_evolver:
  min_trials: 20            # Minimum evaluations before a mutation is accepted
  min_improvement: 0.05     # Minimum quality delta to promote a mutation
  significance_level: 0.05  # p-value threshold for statistical significance
```

### `config/quality_thresholds.yaml`

Per-task-type quality gates. Tasks that score below these thresholds are not recorded as training data.

| Task Type | Minimum Quality |
|---|---|
| `security_audit` | 0.85 |
| `test_generation` | 0.80 |
| `code_review` | 0.75 |
| `code` | 0.75 |
| `planning` | 0.65 |
| `creative` | 0.60 |
| `general` | 0.70 |

---

## Installation

Training requires optional GPU dependencies that are not installed by default:

```bash
pip install -e ".[training]"
```

This installs: `torch`, `peft`, `trl`, `bitsandbytes`, `unsloth`, `datasets`, `transformers`.

Without these packages, the pipeline operates in **data collection and curriculum planning mode only** — it gathers training records and plans activities but does not execute fine-tuning runs.

---

## State and Persistence

All persistent training state lives under `~/.vetinari/` by default. `VETINARI_STATE_DIR` overrides the location.

| Location | Contents |
|---|---|
| `~/.vetinari/training_data/` | Seed datasets downloaded by `vetinari train seed` |
| `~/.vetinari/replay_buffer.jsonl` | Past training examples for continual learning (max 5,000) |
| `~/.vetinari/adapters/registry.json` | LoRA adapter registry — maps skill names to adapter paths |
| `~/.vetinari/agent_training_history.jsonl` | Per-agent training log with timestamps and metrics |
| `$KAIZEN_DB_PATH` | Kaizen improvement store (SQLite) |
| `$VETINARI_STATE_DIR/operator_selector_state.json` | Thompson Sampling arm states for prompt mutation |
| `outputs/feedback/feedback.jsonl` | User thumbs-up/thumbs-down feedback for replay |
